Customer Behaviour Analysis – Data Analytics Project
⭐ Overview
This project analyzes customer behaviour to uncover insights about purchasing patterns, spending habits, and the impact of discounts. The workflow includes loading and exploring data using Python, cleaning and transforming it, running SQL queries for deeper analysis, building an interactive Power BI dashboard, and finally preparing a report and presentation.

📁 Dataset
Contains customer demographic details, purchase amounts, product preferences, and discount usage.
Loaded in Python for initial exploration and cleaning.
Structure includes columns such as: customer_id, gender, purchase_amount, product_category, discount_applied, and more.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA
SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) – Querying, aggregation, and validation
Power BI – Dashboard creation and visualization
Gamma App – Automated presentation creation
Jupyter Notebook – Code execution and documentation
